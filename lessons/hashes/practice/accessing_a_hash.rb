# How would we get the value of:

# 1. "socks"
p suitcase["socks"]
# 2. "pants"
p suitcase["pants"]
# 3. All of the values in this hash.
p suitcase.values
# How would we get the keys of the above hash?
p suitcase.keys



#p suitcase would return {"socks"=>4, "pants"=>1}
#the method keys returns an array of all the keys in the hash example
#the method values returns an array of all the values in the hash
