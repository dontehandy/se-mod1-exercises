# Remember in Ruby, symbols are basically Strings that canâ€™t change.
# You can recognize a symbol because it starts with a colon :.
# All of the following are symbols:
# :name
# :symbols_can_have_underscores
# :"symbols can be in quotes"

# Lets change the hash above to use symbols instead of strings.
# Syntax symbol with hash rocket:
# create hash here

new_tv = {:screen_size => 50, :price => 300, :brand => "Samsung" }

when asking for the value of a key in a hash, you can use the key as a symbol
#new_tv[:screen_size]


# Syntax symbol without hash rocket:
# create hash here


: starts with a colon
